# libselinux.so.1
# Workaround for:
# sed: error while loading shared libraries: libpcre.so.3: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
# Some distributions, such as Arch Linux, do not come with libselinux.so.1 by default.
# The solution is to bundle a dummy mock library:
# echo "extern int is_selinux_enabled(void){return 0;}" >> selinux-mock.c
# gcc -s -shared -o libselinux.so.1 -Wl,-soname,libselinux.so.1 selinux-mock.c
# strip libselinux.so.1
# More information: https://github.com/AppImage/AppImages/issues/83

# The following are assumed to be part of the base system
# Removing these has worked e.g., for Krita. Feel free to report if
# you think that some of these should go into AppImages and why.
